# Git on the Command Line

We can use the git version control application from the command line. Here aer some useful commands to get started.

- `git status` - this will give you the current status of your git repository
- `git add .` - Us ethis command to "stage" all of your current changes so that they are ready to be committed
- `git commit -m "your msg"` - this command will take all of the staged changes and create a snapshot of the current state of your repository. Using commits is how we generate a "commit history" for our repository
- `git pull` - Use this commmand to grab any changes form your remote repository (eg. github.com) and pull them down onto your local repository (the one on your computer)
- `git push` - This command will take whatever commits you have on your computer and push them to the remote repository on github.com

There are a lot of things learn whin it comes to working with git, but these commands are the day-to-day ones that you will do as you work with version control.

**Tip** YOu should make frequent, small commits when workin on your project
